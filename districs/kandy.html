    <p class="p1">Central Highlands, almost dead centre in the little island of Sri Lanka lays Kandy City. The crown jewel of the city is the famed Sri Dalada Maligawa, also known as the Temple of the Tooth. ‘Maligawa’ literally translates to palace, and the temple
        is part of the palace complex. The entire complex is over three centuries old at least, and has seen many a king’s rise and fall. It has seen bloody wars and peaceful reigns and is one of the most historical places still standing in the island
    </p>

    <p class="p1">The entire temple complex, from peaked tiled roofs to white walls with large airy windows, is built using classical Kandyan architecture. The main shrine has two floors. There are various chambers in the floors including the one where the tooth relic
        is kept known as ‘handun kunama’. The door to that chamber is carved in ivory and inside the tooth rests on seven gemstone-studded golden caskets.</p>

    <p class="p1">The Temple of the Tooth is an art and history lover’s paradise. The first thing a visitor sees as they approach the entrance gates which lie over the moat is the large carved entrance arch with its elephants on either side. The ground before the entrance
        has a carved ‘welcome mat’, also known as a ‘moon stone’. The moonstone is similar to a full moon cut in half with rows of animals and other carvings depicted in concentric rows inside the sector. The flat area is placed along the edge of the
        entrance with the curved area facing the visitor.</p>

    <p class="p1">The insides of the shrine are covered in beautifully detailed and elaborate paintings. With low curved ceilings of corridors and paved floors with their stones polished by a million feet, the shrine transports its visitors to a different age when
        kings walked the soil of Sri Lanka. In addition to the main shrine there are other attractions such as the Royal Palace that now spends its days as an archeological museum, the Audience Chamber which now doubles as a chamber for ceremonies, and
        various other associated structures.</p> <br> <br>

    <p class="p1">Botany is the scientific study of plants. There are over 315,000 plant species around the world. The number continues to increase as new species continue to be discovered. Botanical gardens aim to collect, cultivate and display as many plants as possible,
        all labelled under their botanical names.</p>
    <p class="p1">Botanical Gardens began their life as medieval medicinal gardens called ‘physic gardens’ in Europe. They were initially founded in the 16th century during Italian Renaissance period though some records prove the existence of small scale physic gardens
        as early as the 14th century.</p>

    <p class="p1"> As botany was established as a subject separate from medicine in the 17th century, plant imports from explorations around the world began to be cultivated. During the 18th century proper methods plant classification and cultivation of foreign plants
        became known and many botanical gardens were established in tropical countries. The Royal Botanical Gardens in Kew near London played a central role in uniting the various botanical researches being conducted in the other gardens.</p>

    <p class="p1"> As the years have passed botanical gardens have taken a major place in culture and botany. They have been places of great advances in science and horticulture.</p><br><br>

        road that leads to the village of Meemure too can be travelled by a vehicle having good ground clearance.</p>
