    <P class="p1">Colombo is the commercial capital and largest city of Sri Lanka by population. According to the Brookings Institution, Colombo metropolitan area has a population of 5.6 million, and 752,993 in the city proper. It is the financial centre of the island
        and a tourist destination. It is located on the west coast of the island and adjacent to the Greater Colombo area which includes Sri Jayawardenepura Kotte, the legislative capital of Sri Lanka and Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia.</P>

    <p class="p1">Colombo is often referred to as the capital since Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte is within the urban area of, and a suburb of, Colombo. It is also the administrative capital of the Western Province and the district capital of Colombo District. Colombo
        is a busy and vibrant city with a mixture of modern life, colonial buildings and monuments.</p>

    <p class="p1"> Jayewardenepura Kotte, formerly Kotte, city and legislative capital of Sri Lanka. It is located in the southwestern part of the country, about 5 miles (8 km) southeast of the commercial capital of Colombo, of which it was once a suburb. An urban council
        governs Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte and the neighbouring town of Nugegoda. Despite the city’s urban character, it contains a number of rice paddies and plantations.</p>

    <p class="p1">As Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, it was the capital of the Sinhalese kingdom of Kotte from 1415 to 1565, largely owing to the lagoons, rivers, and swamps that still encircle it and provide a natural defense. Its partition at the beginning of the 16th
        century culminated in the Portuguese domination of Ceylon (present-day Sri Lanka). At some point the city’s name was abbreviated to Kotte. When the first Portuguese envoys were taken from Colombo to Kotte in 1505, the Sinhalese led them on a circuitous
        three-day trip to conceal the capital’s location. “To go to Kotte” thus became a Sinhalese synonym for a roundabout route.</p><br><br>

    <h1 class="sub">Lotus Tower</h1>

    </div>

    <p class="p1"> Tower also referred to as Colombo Lotus Tower, is a tower 350 m high, located in Colombo, Sri Lanka. It has been called a symbolic landmark of Sri Lanka. As of 2019, the tower is the tallest self-supported structure in South Asia; the second tallest
        structure in South Asia after the guy-wire-supported INS Kattabomman in India; the 11th tallest tower in Asia and the 19th tallest tower in the world. It was first proposed to be built in the suburb of Peliyagoda but later the Government of Sri
        Lanka decided to change the location. The lotus-shaped tower is used for communication, observation and other leisure facilities. Construction costed $104.3 million. </p><br><br>

    </div>

    <p class="p1"> Arcade Independence Square is a high-end shopping complex housed in a group of renovated colonial era buildings in Colombo. It’s portrays a truly exemplary story of emergence from the depths of despair into a new life of hope and joy.</p>

    <p class="p1">The Arcade Independence Square started its life as a Mental Asylum in the late 19th century. In 1875, Sir William Gregory, who was the Governor at the time, decided to build a new aylum to replace the existing facility at Borella. This decision was
        based on the learned recommendations of the Principal Civil Medical Officer, Dr. W R Kynsey; who realized that the stresses of the repeated invasions and colonization of Sri Lanka had resulted in mental instability amongst some of the populace.</p><br><br>
