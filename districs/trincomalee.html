    <P class="p1">Trincomalee District is one of the 25 districts of Sri Lanka, the second-level administrative division of the country. The district is administered by a District Secretariat headed by a District Secretary (previously known as a Government Agent) appointed
        by the central government of Sri Lanka. The capital of the district is the city of Trincomalee.The population of the district, like the rest of the east and north, has been heavily affected by the civil war. The war killed an estimated 100,000
        people.
    </P>

    <p class="p1">Several hundred thousand Sri Lankan Tamils, possibly as much as one million, emigrated to the West during the war. Many Sri Lankan Tamils also moved to the relative safety of the capital Colombo. The war also caused many people from all ethnic and
        religious groups who lived in the district to flee to other parts of Sri Lanka, though most of them have returned to the district since the end of the civil war.</p>
