    <P class="p1">Matara is a town on the southern coast of Sri Lanka, 160 km from Colombo. It is one of the biggest cities in Sri Lanka. The town has many remnants of Sri Lanka? Is the colonial past divided by the island? The third longest river, the Nilwala Ganga?
        Blue River, huh? A beautiful, wide expanse of water that divides the old town from the new.In the 16th and 18th centuries, Matara was ruled by the Portuguese and the Dutch. Culture and architecture can still be seen in the area. </P>

    <p class="p1">The popular Lighthouse in Point Dondra was built by the Dutch and is considered to be one of the most beautiful and oldest lighthouses in Sri Lanka. Matara is a busy, booming and thriving commercial city that owes almost nothing to tourism â€“ which
        can turn it into a fascinating window of modern Sri Lankan life. The main attractions of Matara are its ramparts, Dutch architecture, well-preserved fortress and street life.</p>

        with a minuscule island called Taprobane, just offshore.</p>

    <p class="p1">Sheltered by a dense covering of luxuriant tropical trees therein is an exquisite villa painted in white. Close to the southern end are dozens of colorful outrigger catamarans lined up ready to go into the sea once again. Weligama bay beach with its
        low waves is an ideal location to learn Matara. Swimming, Snorkling and other watersports too are done at Weligama beach.</p><br><br>

        of kilometers beyond the lovely beach of Weligama, almost hidden from the dense groves of coconut palm trees that fringe the bay lies the loveliest beach Mirissa. It's the beach to swim, snorkel, sport fishing, sea kayaking, cruises around the
        bay and other water sports.</p>

    <p class="p1">Mirissa affords the opportunity to view one of the most exciting marine life attractions of beautiful beaches of Sri Lanka: blue whales. During the period of December to April within a 6 hour boat ride, blue whales could be sighted a few kilometers
        into the seas at Mirissa.Mirissa with its bay and fishing harbor has been simply a fishing village that used to host you in such a way for you to feel as if here is an exclusive private beach all for your serene loneliness. That was until its
        discovery by others.Today, Mirissa is a village bent on development.</p><br><br>
