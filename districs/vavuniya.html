    <P class="p1">Vavuniya District is one of the 25 districts of Sri Lanka, the second level administrative division of the country. The district is administered by a District Secretariat headed by a District Secretary (previously known as a Government Agent) appointed
        by the central government of Sri Lanka. The capital of the district is the city of Vavuniya.</P>

    <p class="p1">Vanni District was later renamed Mullaitivu District and then Vavuniya District. At the time that Ceylon gained independence, Vavuniya was one of the three districts located in the Northern Province. Mullaitivu District was carved out of the northern
        part of Vavuniya District in September 1978. Parts of Vavuniya District were under the control of rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam for many years during the civil war. The entire district was recaptured by the Sri Lankan military in 2008.</p>

    <p class="p1">Madukanda village is located in the Vavuniya District and is about 4 kilometers off Vavuniya town along the Horowpothana road. This villageâ€™s significance can be established at least from the 4th century. Madukanda is considered the first Dalada Maligaya
        (House for the Tooth Relic) which was built in the country. The relic was brought to Sri Lanka by princess Hemamali and prince Danta during the reign of king Sirimeghavanna (Kithsiri Mevan- 303-311) .</p>

    <p class="p1">Close by to Madukanda, on the rock called Thonigala lies one of the most important rock inscriptions in the country king Sirimeghavanna describing operations of a Grain Bank in the area. The old Madukanda walawwa with its court where the last Rate
        Mahaththaya resided is the last walawwa towards the North of the country as well as the last Pirivena (Buddhist center for learning) towards North is also centered around Madukanda Viharaya.</p><br><br>
