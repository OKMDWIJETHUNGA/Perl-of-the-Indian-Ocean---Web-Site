    <P class="p1">Anuradhapura is a major city in Sri Lanka. It is the capital city of North Central Province, Sri Lanka and the capital of Anuradhapura District. Anuradhapura is one of the ancient capitals of Sri Lanka, famous for its well-preserved ruins of an ancient
        Sinhala civilization. It was the third capital of the kingdom of Rajarata, following the kingdoms of Tambapanni and Upatissa Nuwara.</P>

    <p class="p1">The city, now a World Heritage site, was the centre of Theravada Buddhism for many centuries. The city lies 205 km (127 mi) north of the current capital of Colombo in the North Central Province, on the banks of the historic Malvathu River. It is one
        of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and one of the eight World Heritage Sites of Sri Lanka.</p>

    <p class="p1">Sacred Bo tree Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya of Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka is the oldest living tree in the documented history of the world. It is a sapling from the historical Bodhi tree under which Buddha enlightened. It was planted in 288 BCF and is the oldest
        living human-planted tree in the world with known planting date. It was brought from Buddhagaya India by the Ven. Sanghamitta Therini, a sister of Arhant Mahinda – who introduced the Teachings of the Buddha to Sri Lanka. </p>

    <p class="p1">The area around the Sri Maha Bodhi, the Brazen Palace, and Ruwanweliseya Dagoba was once probably part of the Great Temple. The Sacred Bodhi tree is the oldest historically authenticated tree in the world, It has been tended by a continuous succession
        of guardians for over 2000 years, even during the periods of Indian occupation.</p><br><br>


    <h1 class="sub">Ruwanweliseya</h1>

    <div class="distric">

    <p class="p1">Anuradhapura The Ruwanweliseya was built by King Dutugemunu in the 2nd century BCE. Since being restored the dome is clear and shines white in the sun. S.M. Burrows of the Ceylon Civil Service wrote in 1885, “Its present height is about 150 feet,
        with a diameter of 379 feet. It is now being restored by the pious contributions of pilgrims, and the zealous efforts of the Chief Priest. The Dagoba was originally surrounded by two large paved courts or platforms, the inner one raised above
        the outer.</p>

    <p class="p1">Round the outer side of the boundary-wall there was originally a complete circle of elephants, made out of brickwork, and coated with Chunam each elephant being furnished, says the Mahavamsa or Great Chronicle of Sri Lanka, compiled in about the 6th
        century AD with tusks of real ivory. Most of these figures have fallen away beyond recognition; but in some few, the shape of the animal is still plainly discernable.”</p><br><br>
