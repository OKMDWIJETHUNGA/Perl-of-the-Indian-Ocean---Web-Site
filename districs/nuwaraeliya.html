    <p class="p1">Nuwara Eliya District is a district in Central Province, Sri Lanka, centered on the tourist city of Nuwara Eliya. Its name means "city on the plain (table land)" or "city of light". The city is the administrative capital of Nuwara Eliya District,
        with a picturesque landscape and temperate climate. </p>
    <p class="p1"> It is at an altitude of 1,868 m (6,128 ft) and is considered to be the most important location for tea production in Sri Lanka. The city is overlooked by Pidurutalagala, the tallest mountain in Sri Lanka. Nuwara Eliya is known for its temperate, cool
        climate – the coolest area in Sri Lanka.</p>

    <h1 class="sub">Pidurutalagala</h1>

    </div>

    <p class="p1">Pidurutalagala Mountain in Sri Lanka (literally translating to Straw Plateau Rock), which is also called Mount Pedro in English is the tallest mountain on the island and situated in the Central Province, north – northeast to the town of Nuwara Eliya.
        It is also the only ultra prominent peak on the island, and one of only 1515 ultra prominent peaks around the world.</p>
    <p class="p1">An ultra prominent peak is a mountain that has topographic prominence (height of the peak’s summit above the lowest contour line encircling it up to the highest summit) above 1500 meters. Mount Pedro has prominence and elevation of 2524m (8281 feet)
        (8292 feet according to the Survey Department).</p>

    <p class="p1">The mountain of Pidurutalagala has a forest reserve surrounding it. The forest underwent damage five years ago in a forest fire, causing the loss of some 3 acres of forest. However, the damage is being repaired now with the assistance of nature and
        human intervention. The area of the mountain and forest reserve has been designated an ultra-high security zone due to the summit being used to house the communications array of the Sri Lankan Government and the Armed Forces of the country.</p><br><br>

    <h1 class="sub">Horton Plains</h1>

    <div class="distric">
        <img src="/image/hortan1.jpg" width="450px" height="350px">
        <img src="/image/hortan2.jpg" width="450px" height="350px">
        <img src="/image/hortan3.jpg" width="450px" height="350px">
    </div>

    <p class="p1">Horton Plains in Sri Lanka, is the coldest and windiest location in the country. It consists of ecosystems such as Montane evergreen forests, grasslands, marshy lands and aquatic ecosystem. At an altitude of 2,100 meters above sea level, Horton Plains
        spreads across over 3,169 hectares of the highest tableland of the island. In view of the large number of endemic flora and fauna species, Horton Plains was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site on 30th July 2010.</p>

    <p class="p1">Horton Plains, its surroundings, forests and the adjoining Peak Wilderness constitute Sri Lanka’s most important catchment area of almost all major rivers. The plains are also of outstanding scenic beauty and conservation importance, containing most
        of the habitats and endemic plants and animals representative of the country’s wet and Montane zones. </p>

    <p class="p1">The western slopes support the most extensive area of Montane cloud forest surviving in the island. Horton Plains is not merely a destination for nature tourists. Since the rich biodiversity of Horton Plains is still grossly underexplored, it affords
        invaluable opportunities to those engaged on educational and research activities. Protecting Horton Plains is a call of duty for all Sri Lankans.</p><br><br>

    <h1 class="sub">Aberdeen Falls</h1>

    <div class="distric">
        <img src="/image/aber1.jpg" width="450px" height="350px">
        <img src="/image/aber2.jpg" width="450px" height="350px">
        <img src="/image/aber3.jpg" width="450px" height="350px">
    </div>

    <p class="p1">Aberdeen Falls is a 98 m (322 ft) high waterfall on the Kehelgamu Oya near Ginigathena, in the Nuwara Eliya District of Sri Lanka. Aberdeen is named after Aberdeen, the third largest city in Scotland and the capital of Aberdeenshire. Kehelgamu Oya
        is a major tributary of the Kelani River.
    </p>
    <p class="p1">To reach Aberdeen Falls from Ginigathena town, one then must proceed along Ambatale Road up to the Buddha statue at the end of the road. Then one should park their vehicle and walk about 1.2 km along the road. Bathing in the middle of the pool and
        swimming to the middle has caused death to swimmers in the past. This waterfall is covered with a big stone complex behind. The waterfall is ranked as the 18th highest on the Island.</p><br><br>

    <h1 class="sub">Victoria Park </h1>

    </div>

    <p class="p1"> Victoria Park is a public park located in Nuwara Eliya, next to the Nuwara Eliya Post Office in Sri Lanka. Originally the park was the research field of Hakgala Botanical Garden. The park was formally named in 1897 to commemorate Queen Victoria’s
        Diamond Jubilee.</p>
    <p class="p1"> The park was established with the planting of its first tree, an Oak, by a visiting German Princess. The Nanu Oya River runs through the park, creating a number of small lakes. A number of rare bird species can be found in the park. At the far end
        of the park is a small children’s playground and miniature ridable railway.</p><br><br>
