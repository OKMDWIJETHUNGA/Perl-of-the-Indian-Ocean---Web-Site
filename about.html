    <h2 class="ha"><i>Our History</i></h2>
    <hr>

    <p class="pi">In 1966, the Government of Sri Lanka decided to develop tourism in a planned and systematic manner, after identifying the need to set up an institutional framework. The Ceylon Tourist Board, (created by the Ceylon Tourist Board Act No. 10 of 1966.)
        and the Ceylon Hotels Corporation, (created by Ceylon Hotels Corporation Act of 1966.) were set up to enable this.The Tourism Act No 38 of 2005 came into effect in October 2007, replacing the Sri Lanka Tourist Board Act No 10 of 1966, which was
        in effect for the past 41 years. In terms of the provisions contained in the new act, the Tourism Development Fund was legally constituted, with 2 main sources, (1/3rd of the Airport Tax collections and 1% of the Turnover of all Sri Lanka Tourist
        Board registered establishments.) contributing finances to the fund.
        <br>
        <br> The Act provided for the setting up of the Sri Lanka Tourism development Authority, thereby replacing the Sri Lanka Tourist Board. The Tourism Promotion Bureau was set up to manage Marketing and Promotion.
        <br>
        <br> Tourism HRD functions and the Hotels School operations are currently undertaken by the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management. The Sri Lanka Convention Bureau was also restructured as a statutory body like other Institutions to
        be managed by an independent Board of Management.</p>
