    <p class="p1">Sabaragamuwa is yet another province of Sri Lanka, located in the south-central region of the island and is comprised of two administrative districts: Ratnapura and Kegalle. Sabaragamuwa is named after its former indigenous inhabitants, namely the
        Sabara, an Indic term for hunter gatherer tribes, a term seldom used in ancient Sri Lanka. The province is well known for its gem industry, particularly the Ratnapura District. Apart from gem industry, the province is known for rice and fruit
        cultivations and rubber plantations. In the province are also tourist attractions such as the Sinharaja Forest Reserve, Udawalawa National Park, Kitulgala, and Adam’s Peak etc.</p>

    <p class="p1">The capital of the province is Ratnapura, the name means `city of gems’, a city most known for the long established gem industry in Sri Lanka. Most of the people of the town depend on the gem trade. Gem pits are a common site in the surrounding area.
        Most of the large-scale gem businessmen operate from Ratnapura. There are a considerable number of foreign gem traders too operating in the town.</p>
